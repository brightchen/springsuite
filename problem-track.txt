  - Problem: when run my.bc.studio.smartdbtool.test.Tester1, system keep on throwing exception( "Unsupported by BasicDataSource" ) when trying create JPA.
    tracking into the BasicDataSource and found the method "getConnection(String user, String pass)" instead of "getConnection()" was called, 
    and in fact "getConnection(String user, String pass)" is not supported by BasicDataSource ( see BasicDataSource api ), So BasicDataSource will throw
    UnsupportedException().
  - Reason: there has a file "hibernate.properties" which was under directory "studio/src/main/resources", and in fact the properties in this file was used.
    rename this file into "hibernate.properties.bak" and problem solved.
  - Further dig: why the properties of "hibernate.properties" have higher priority than "studo-persistent.properties" which used 
    by spring "PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer"
    

  - problem: error for "persistence.xml" says "The persistence.xml file does not have supported content for this JPA platform" after changed the schema from "1.0" to "2.0".
  - reason: The cause was the JPA Facet was set to JPA Version 1.0, however my persistence.xml file was specifying JPA Version 2. 
    So I changed the JPA Facet to version 2.0 and the problem went away. 
    (Project --> Properties --> Project Facets --> "Configuration" drop down --> set this to "Minimal JPA 2.0 configuration" 
    clean the project for recompile after done the change.
