  - Problem: when run my.bc.studio.smartdbtool.test.Tester1, system keep on throwing exception( "Unsupported by BasicDataSource" ) when trying create JPA.
    tracking into the BasicDataSource and found the method "getConnection(String user, String pass)" instead of "getConnection()" was called, 
    and in fact "getConnection(String user, String pass)" is not supported by BasicDataSource ( see BasicDataSource api ), So BasicDataSource will throw
    UnsupportedException().
  - Reason: there has a file "hibernate.properties" which was under directory "studio/src/main/resources", and in fact the properties in this file was used.
    rename this file into "hibernate.properties.bak" and problem solved.
  - Further dig: why the properties of "hibernate.properties" have higher priority than "studo-persistent.properties" which used 
    by spring "PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer"
